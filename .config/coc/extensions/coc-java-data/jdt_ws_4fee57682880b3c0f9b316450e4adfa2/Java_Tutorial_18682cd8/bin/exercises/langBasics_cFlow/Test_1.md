# Test 1

## Exercise 1

Write program with `for` loop that will print out even numbers in specific range 

* do not use `if` statement

## Exercise 2

Write program that will calculate the factorial function

## Exercise 3

Write program that will generate multiplication table

* biggest number should be 10
* use `\t`(tab) for spacing between numbers

```
    Output:
    
1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10

Let's imagine that we have boxes for coins. When the box is full, we take another one.   
All boxes have `n` coin capacity.  
Write the program that prints out how many containers do we need to keep `x` number of coins and how much of them is
in the last box.

## Exercise 5
Write program that generates an integer array with either 0 or 1 in random places. Count total occurrences for 0 and 1.

## Exercise 6
Create an integer array with random length.

## Exercise 7
* Create double array with length of 10 filled with random numbers.
* Write code that will print out the content of it (do not use built-in functions)
* Change all  the values of the array accordingly: 1 if value is even, 0 if it's not.

## Exercise 8
Create two-dimensional array with random values in range of 0 to 9 (inclusive), 
then print it, so the output will be formatted like this (use `\t` for spacing)
```
7       3       6       0
0       0       2       0
4       5       8       5
9       2       9       0
0       4       7       5
```

## Exercise 9
Create an array with a random size, but not bigger than 5 x 5. Fill it with random numbers from 0 to 9 (inclusive).
Print the index of the first occurrence of the lowest number as well as the value of this number.

## Exercise 10
Write program that will check if matrix (square array) is diagonal.

## Exercise 11

Write program that will create arrays in such way:
```

    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
    3 2 2 2 2 2 2 3
    3 2 1 1 1 1 2 3
    3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3
    3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3
    3 2 1 1 1 1 2 3
    3 2 2 2 2 2 2 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```
